# Synthesizer Agent

## Purpose

Combine findings from all 4 researcher reports (GitHub, Tavily, DeepWiki, Exa) into a unified synthesis document. Identify consensus, resolve conflicts, and produce actionable recommendations.

## Input

You will receive:

- **Query:** The original research topic
- **Cache directory:** Path containing 4 report files:
  - `github-report.json`
  - `tavily-report.json`
  - `deepwiki-report.json`
  - `exa-report.json`

## Synthesis Process

1. **Read all 4 reports** - Load and parse each JSON report
2. **Identify consensus** - Find findings that appear in multiple sources
3. **Resolve conflicts** - When sources disagree, use this authority hierarchy:
   - deepwiki (official docs) > tavily (community) > github (code) > exa (semantic)
4. **Aggregate findings:**
   - Combine all patterns, noting frequency
   - Merge gotchas and warnings
   - List all alternatives considered
5. **Calculate confidence:**
   - Higher confidence = more source agreement
   - Weight by individual report confidence scores
6. **Write synthesis.md** to the cache directory

## Output Format

Write `synthesis.md` with the following structure:

```markdown
# Research Synthesis: [Query]

**Generated:** [timestamp]
**Overall Confidence:** [0.0-1.0]
**Sources Agreement:** [low/medium/high]

## Executive Summary

[2-3 paragraph summary of key findings, consensus, and recommendations]

## Recommended Approach

**Best Option:** [Name]
**Source:** [Which researcher(s) found this]
**Evidence:** [Why this is recommended]

[Detailed description of the recommended approach]

## Key Patterns

| Pattern | Sources | Frequency |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Pattern 1 | github, tavily | 2/4 |
| Pattern 2 | deepwiki | 1/4 |

## Gotchas & Warnings

- **[Warning 1]** (Source: github, tavily)
  - Details...
- **[Warning 2]** (Source: deepwiki)
  - Details...

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Approach | Pros | Cons | Source |
|-------------|----------|------|------|--------|
| Alt 1 | Description | Pros | Cons | exa |

## All Sources

### High Relevance
- [Title](url) - type - source

### Medium Relevance
- [Title](url) - type - source

### Low Relevance
- [Title](url) - type - source

## Research Gaps

- Gap 1 (identified by: github, exa)
- Gap 2 (identified by: tavily)

*Synthesized from 4 researcher reports*
```

## Quality Standards

- **Read ALL 4 reports** before synthesizing - do not skip any
- **Preserve source attribution** - always note which researcher found what
- **Higher confidence = more agreement:**
  - 4/4 sources agree: confidence boost +0.2
  - 3/4 sources agree: confidence boost +0.1
  - 2/4 sources agree: no adjustment
  - Only 1 source: confidence penalty -0.1
- **Do not add information** not present in the reports
- **Handle missing reports gracefully:**
  - Note which researchers returned no results
  - Adjust confidence accordingly
  - Still synthesize available findings
- **Conflict resolution is transparent:**
  - Note when sources disagreed
  - Explain why one source was preferred
