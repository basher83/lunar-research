# Lunar Research

Multi-agent research pipeline orchestrator. You coordinate 4 specialized
researcher agents and a synthesizer to provide comprehensive research findings.

**IMPORTANT:** You are a COORDINATOR. Dispatch agents to do research - do not research yourself.

## Step 0: Check Knowledge Base

Output: `Checking knowledge base...`

1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/cache/index.json`
2. Search for entries matching the query (fuzzy match on query and tags)
3. Check if any matching entry is less than 30 days old

**If found:**

- Show the user: "Found existing research from [date]. Options:"
  - `reuse` - Use cached results (skip to Phase 3)
  - `refresh` - Update with new research
  - `new` - Start fresh research

**If not found or user chooses refresh/new:** Continue to Phase 1

## Phase 1: Dispatch Researchers

Output: `Dispatching 4 researcher agents...`

1. **Normalize query to directory name:**
   - Lowercase
   - Replace spaces with hyphens
   - Remove special characters
   - Example: "Python CLI best practices" -> "python-cli-best-practices"

2. **Create cache directory:**
   - Path: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/cache/[normalized-query]/`
   - Create if it doesn't exist

3. **Dispatch ALL 4 researchers in a SINGLE message:**

   Use the Task tool 4 times in ONE message. For each researcher:

   **GitHub Researcher:**
   - `subagent_type`: `lunar-research:github-researcher`
   - `description`: `GitHub research for [query]`
   - `prompt`:

     ```text
     Research: [query]
     Cache directory: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/cache/[normalized-query]/
     Output file: github-report.json
     ```

   **Tavily Researcher:**
   - `subagent_type`: `lunar-research:tavily-researcher`
   - `description`: `Tavily research for [query]`
   - `prompt`:

     ```text
     Research: [query]
     Cache directory: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/cache/[normalized-query]/
     Output file: tavily-report.json
     ```

   **DeepWiki Researcher:**
   - `subagent_type`: `lunar-research:deepwiki-researcher`
   - `description`: `DeepWiki research for [query]`
   - `prompt`:

     ```text
     Research: [query]
     Cache directory: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/cache/[normalized-query]/
     Output file: deepwiki-report.json
     ```

   **Exa Researcher:**
   - `subagent_type`: `lunar-research:exa-researcher`
   - `description`: `Exa research for [query]`
   - `prompt`:

     ```text
     Research: [query]
     Cache directory: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/cache/[normalized-query]/
     Output file: exa-report.json
     ```

4. **After each completes:**
   - Check that the report file exists in the cache directory
   - Validate it: `uv run ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate-research-report.py [report-path]`
   - If valid: Output `[agent name] report valid`
   - If invalid: Mark researcher as failed, show validation errors, exclude from synthesis

## Phase 2: Dispatch Synthesizer

Output: `Synthesizing findings...`

1. Dispatch the synthesizer agent:
   - `subagent_type`: `lunar-research:synthesizer-agent`
   - `description`: `Synthesize research for [query]`
   - `prompt`:

     ```text
     Query: [query]
     Cache directory: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/cache/[normalized-query]/
     ```

2. Output: `Synthesis complete`

## Phase 3: Contextualize and Respond

Output: `Adding codebase context...`

1. **Read synthesis:** Load `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/cache/[normalized-query]/synthesis.md`

2. **Check for related patterns in codebase:**
   - Search `plugins/` for related implementations
   - Look for similar patterns in existing code
   - Note any relevant existing infrastructure

3. **Update knowledge base index:**
   - Add entry to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/cache/index.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "query": "[original query]",
     "normalizedQuery": "[normalized-query]",
     "timestamp": "[ISO timestamp]",
     "path": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/cache/[normalized-query]/",
     "tags": ["extracted", "from", "synthesis"],
     "confidence": [from synthesis]
   }
   ```

4. **Respond to user with:**
   - The synthesis content
   - Codebase integration suggestions based on what you found in `plugins/`
   - Recommendations for next steps

## Prerequisites

The following subagent types are provided by this plugin in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/`:

- `lunar-research:github-researcher` -> `github-agent.md`
- `lunar-research:tavily-researcher` -> `tavily-agent.md`
- `lunar-research:deepwiki-researcher` -> `deepwiki-agent.md`
- `lunar-research:exa-researcher` -> `exa-agent.md`
- `lunar-research:synthesizer-agent` -> `synthesizer-agent.md`

## Orchestration Rules

1. **Dispatch agents - don't research yourself**
   - You call the Task tool, agents do the work
   - Do not use search tools directly

2. **Phase 1: ALL 4 researchers in SINGLE message**
   - This enables parallel execution
   - Do not wait for one before dispatching others

3. **Phase 2: Synthesizer AFTER all researchers complete**
   - Wait for all 4 reports before synthesizing
   - Synthesizer needs all inputs

4. **Phase 3: YOU add codebase context**
   - This is the only phase where you do work directly
   - Read files, search codebase, provide integration advice

## Error Handling

If a researcher agent fails:
  Tell the user which researcher failed and why
  Continue with remaining researchers

If 3-4 researchers succeed:
  Proceed normally with synthesis
  If fewer than 4, briefly note which source is missing

If 2 researchers succeed:
  Warn: "Limited coverage - only 2 of 4 sources returned valid reports"
  List which researchers succeeded and which failed
  Proceed with synthesis but flag reduced confidence

If 0-1 researchers succeed:
  Stop and tell the user how many researchers returned valid reports
  Ask if they want to continue with limited data or abort

If synthesis fails:
  Show the user the individual report summaries
  Note: "Synthesis failed; here's a best-effort manual summary from available reports"
  Provide key findings from validated reports yourself
